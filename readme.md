## Usage

`Usage:`

`gsshs	<github account email> <github user name>`

---------------------------------------

1) Save your login for Github in your default browser.

2) Execute `./gsshs <github account email> <github user name>` found in the portable release using a Terminal application. Alternatively if you have install the `.deb` or `.rpm` package files,ÃŸ `gsshs` will be available as a global user command to the system, so just `gsshs <github account email> <github user name>` works fine.

3) Your default browser will open to the Github SSH key page. Your new SSH key was copied to the clipboard by `gsshs`, so just paste the key and add it. Done.
